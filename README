Welcome to PlanningForDummies!

This is merely a small toolbox so you can familiarize yourself with AI
planning systems. For documentation, please refer to:

http://www.loria.fr/~hoffmanj/papers/ki11.pdf

Sub-directories:

-- FF-v2.3: the FF planning system C source code, including a Linux
   executable

-- gripper: a planning benchmark domain from the 1998 International
   Planning Competition, which is extremely simple and just involves
   moving a robot to transport N balls from a room A to a romm B.

-- hanoi: the Towers-of-Hanoi problem, formulated as a planning
   problem.

-- miconic-ADL: a planning benchmark domain from the 2000
   International Planning Competition, which models a complex elevator
   transportation problem (created in cooperation with Schindler Lifts
   Inc), using complex logical operator preconditions.

Each domain sub-directory contains a file "domain.pddl" which
describes the planning operators, as well as a file of the form
"p-*.pddl" giving an example planning task in this domain, i.e., an
initial and goal state. The language PDDL used here is the standard
from the International Planning Competition. I recommend you have a
look at these files; the syntax should be self-explanatory. Each
domain contains a "GENERATOR" sub-directory, allowing you to generate
larger planning tasks as you wish.

You can run FF directly by running, in the base directory, one of the
following commands:

./ff -o gripper/domain.pddl -f gripper/p-n4.pddl 

./ff -o hanoi/domain.pddl -f hanoi/p-n3.pddl 

./ff -o miconic-ADL/domain.pddl -f miconic-ADL/p-f5-p2.pddl

If you run ./ff without arguments, you get a brief usage
instruction. 

Have fun!
